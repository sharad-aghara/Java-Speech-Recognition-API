## Introduction

This project showcases how to integrate AssemblyAI's Speech-to-Text API into a Java application. It provides an example of sending audio files to the API for transcription and then retrieving the transcribed text.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git


## Usage

  Set up your AssemblyAI API key in the Constants.java file.
  
  Replace the audio_url in Transcript.java with the URL of the audio file you want to transcribe.
  
  Compile and run the RestApiTutorial.java file.
  
  The program will send the audio to AssemblyAI's API for transcription and poll for the transcription status until it's completed.
  
  Once the transcription is complete, the program will display the transcribed text.
